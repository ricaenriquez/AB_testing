#A/B Testing of Udacity's Free Trial Screener by Rica Enriquez
##Experiment Overview: Free Trial Screener

At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on 
the home page: "start free trial", and "access course materials". If the student
clicks "start free trial", they will be asked to enter their credit card 
information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version
of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they 
cancel first. If the student clicks "access course materials", they will be able
to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive 
coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final
project for feedback.

In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked "start
free trial", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the
course. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken
through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per
week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a
greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the
student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the
student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access
the course materials for free instead.

The hypothesis was that this might set clearer expectations for students
upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial
because they didn't have enough timeâ€”without significantly reducing the number
of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course.
If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student
experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to
complete the course.

###Experiment Design
####Metric Choice
The metrics to choose from include:

1. Number of cookies: That is, number of unique cookies to view the course
overview page. (dmin=3000)

2. Number of user-ids: That is, number of users who enroll in the free trial.
(dmin=50)

3. Number of clicks: That is, number of unique cookies to click the "Start free
trial" button (which happens before the free trial screener is trigger).
(dmin=240)

4. Click-through-probability: That is, number of unique cookies to click the
"Start free trial" button divided by number of unique cookies to view the course
overview page. (dmin=0.01)

5. Gross conversion: That is, number of user-ids to complete checkout and enroll
in the free trial divided by number of unique cookies to click the "Start free
trial" button. (dmin= 0.01)

6. Retention: That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day
boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by number of user-ids to
complete checkout. (dmin=0.01)

7. Net conversion: That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the
14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of
unique cookies to click the "Start free trial" button. (dmin= 0.0075)

#####Invariant Metrics
Since invariant metrics should not change between the experiment and control,
the appropriate invariant metrics for this experiment are the number of cookies,
the number of clicks, and the click-through-probability. Since the populations 
before the free trial screener in the experiment and control should be similar, 
the unique number of visitors to the course overview page, the number of users 
to click to the free trial page, and the movement of users from the course 
overview page to the to the initial free trial page should be similar for both 
cases. These metrics would not be useful as evaluation metrics since they do not
provide information about the behavior of users after seeing the the free trial 
screener. Additionally, the other metrics would not be useful as invariant 
metrics because enrollment and beyond are expected to change if the the trial 
screener does have an effect.

#####Evauluation Metrics
The goal of this experiment is to see if the free trial screener has an effect 
on enrollment beyond the free trial. For my evaluation metrics, I consider the
following funnel:

Course Overview Page Visits -> Free Trial Page Visits -> Free Trial Enrollment 
-> Enrollment Past Free Trial

The evaluation metrics to use include:

1. Gross conversion

2. Net conversion

The gross conversion probability provides information about the number of users 
who enroll in the trial after visiting the free trial page and can show if the 
screener prevents users from enrolling in a degree. The net conversion
probability gives a nice summary of the overall number of users that clicked to
go to the free trial page and stayed enrolled past the trial.

The experiment hopes to reduce the number of students who leave the free trial 
without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free 
trial and eventually complete the course. In order to launch the full 
experiment, I would evaluate the gross conversion and net conversion
differences. The gross conversion probability difference should decrease with
the free trial screener and be statistically and practical significant.
Therefore, the minimum confidence interval for the gross conversion difference
should be at least 0.01, or provide a 1% absolute difference. To ensure that the
number of students who continue to the free trial and complete the course does
not significantly decrease, the net conversion probability should not decrease
significantly with the free trial screener. Therefore, the minimum confidence
interval for the net conversion difference should decrease at most by 0.0075.

The number of user-ids was not used as invariant metric because user-ids are 
only made after enrollment, which may be altered by the experiment. 
Additionally, it was not used an an evaluation metric because there may be more
or less total user-ids created in the control or experiment. The gross
conversion provides similar information, but is normalized by the number of
clicks.

The retention probability could potentially be a useful evaluation metric since 
it provides information of the users that remain enrolled after the trial.
However, because the unit of analysis is enrollment, the number of pageviews
needed to do a proper analysis is much too big and the duration of an experiment
would be too long. The net conversion probability is a better metric that can
provide comparable information.

The number of cookies, number of click, and click-through-probability is not 
used as an evaluation metric because it provides information before the free
trial screener. Also, they are used as invariant metrics.

####Measuring Standard Deviation
Assuming a binomial distribution for the evaluation metrics (probabilities), the
standard deviation, $\sigma$, is calculated with $\sigma = \left(\frac{\hat{p}
(1-\hat{p})}{N}\right)^{1/2}$.

The analytical standard deviation of the evaluation metrics, using the control
data are:

Evaluation Metric            Standard Deviation  
--------------------------   ------------------
Gross conversion             0.0202         
Net conversion               0.0156
--------------------------   ------------------

Before enrollment into the free trial, the unit of diversion is a cookie.
Afterwards, the unit of diversion is the user-id. When the unit of analysis and 
unit of diversion do not match, the analytical and empirical variabilities are 
expected to vary. For both evaluation metrics, the unit analysis is a click,
which is different from the unit of diversion.

####Sizing
#####Number of Samples vs. Power
Using gross conversion and net conversion as evaluation metrics, at $\alpha =
0.05$ and $\beta = 0.2$, at least 685,325 pageviews are needed for the planned
analysis (without a Bonferroni correction).

#####Duration vs. Exposure
I use an exposure fraction of 0.5 for this experiment, which means the duration
would be 35 days. This was the smallest fraction that would allow the longest
duration. I did not want all the traffic to go the experiment since there is a
risk of losing many students with the free trial screener. However, it is not so
risky that a small population should be tested. The risk is not high because if
the screener diverts people to enroll later when they have more time, it will
just displace revenue from those users at a later time. Also, if it diverts
users who do not have time, it saves Udacity resources.

###Experiment Analysis
####Sanity Checks
The following table shows the 95% confidence interval and observed value
(control group) of the invariant metrics used. Each invariant metric passed the
sanity check.

Invariant Metric          95% Confidence Interval Observed Value  
------------------------- ----------------------- --------------
Number of cookies         0.4988 to 0.5012         0.5006
Number of clicks          0.4959 to 0.5041         0.5005
Click-through probability 0.0812 to 0.0830         0.0822
------------------------- ----------------------- --------------

In calculating the standard error, a fraction of diversion is 0.5 is used for
pageviews and clicks. For the click-through probability, a binomial distribution
is assumed in calculating it's standard error using the control group's data.

####Result Analysis
For the evaluation metrics, I do not use Bonferroni correction since the metrics
are used and evaluated differently. While we want to show a statistical and 
practical significant decrease in the gross conversion probability, we do not 
want significant changes in the net conversion. Again, the hypothesis was to
reduce the number of students who left the free trial because they didn't have
enough timeâ€”without significantly reducing the number of students to continue
past the free trial and eventually complete the course. The gross conversion is
being used to evaluate the first part. If less students enroll in the free
trial from the beginning, the less students who leave the trial frustrated.

#####Effect Size Tests
Evaluation Metric 95% Confidence Interval Statistically Significant?  Practically Significant?
----------------- ----------------------- --------------------------  ------------------------
Gross conversion  -0.0291 to -0.0120       Yes                         Yes    
Net conversion    -0.0116 to 0.0019        No                          No            
----------------- ----------------------- --------------------------  ------------------------


#####Sign Tests
Evaluation Metric p-value Statistically Significant?
----------------- ------- --------------------------
Gross conversion  0.0026  Yes                            
Net conversion    0.6776  No                                     
----------------- ------- --------------------------

#####Summary
After analyzing the control and experimental groups, I would recommend launching
the experiment since there is a significant decrease, practical and statistical,
in the gross conversion probability, and not a significant change in the net
conversion probability. In other words, the free-trial screener had led to
significant decreases in the the number of users who enroll in the free-trial, but
it has not significantly changed the probability of student staying enrolled past
the free-trial.

###Follow-Up Experiment
```{r echo = FALSE, Follow_Up}
# Give a high-level description of the follow up experiment you would run, what
# your hypothesis would be, what metrics you would want to measure, what your
# unit of diversion would be, and your reasoning for these choices.
```

For a follow-up experiment, I would check if changing the recommended hours in 
the screening to 10 hours/week sets an even clearer expectations for students 
upfront, and further reduces the number of frustrated students who leave the 
free trial. Again, without significantly reducing the number of students to 
continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course. The Udacity 
nanodegree timelines assume a 10 hr/week time commitment, and therefore stating 
a 10 hours/week commitment provides more realistic expectations for students.

This experiment would be very similar to the original experiment. The metrics to 
measure would include number of pageviews, clicks, enrollments, and payments. 
With these, I would calculate click-through-probability, gross conversion, and 
net conversion.

Similarly, the initial unit of diversion is a cookie, although if the student 
enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward. 
The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice. For users that do not 
enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed
in when they visited the course overview page.

For this A/B Test, Test A uses 5 hr/week and Test B uses 10 hr/week for their
time commitment statements. If the hypothesis is true there should be a
significant decreases in the gross conversion and only insignificant decreases
in the net conversion (increases are okay).
